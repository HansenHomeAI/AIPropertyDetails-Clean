# AIPropertyDetails

An AI-powered system for analyzing parcel maps and legal documentation to extract property details, with a primary focus on determining geocoordinates of parcel boundaries for 3D modeling applications.

## Overview

This system uses OpenAI's o4-mini model (released in 2025) for advanced visual reasoning to analyze various types of property documents including:

- Parcel maps
- Plat documents  
- Legal property descriptions
- Survey documents
- Tax assessor maps

The primary goal is to extract precise geocoordinates that define property boundaries, enabling accurate replication in 3D models.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Visual Analysis**: Leverages o4-mini's cutting-edge visual reasoning capabilities
- **Boundary Coordinate Extraction**: Primary focus on determining precise parcel boundary coordinates
- **Multi-Document Support**: Handles various types of property documentation
- **Address & Location Detection**: Extracts property addresses and location information
- **Robust Processing**: Designed for reliable analysis across diverse document formats
- **Local Development**: Flask-based local server for development and testing

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **AI Model**: OpenAI o4-mini (via API)
- **Document Processing**: Advanced image analysis and OCR capabilities
- **Geospatial**: Coordinate extraction and validation
- **Development**: Local development environment with plans for AWS production deployment

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIPropertyDetails.git
cd AIPropertyDetails
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-o4-mini-api-key-here"
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Upload a parcel map or property document
4. Review the extracted boundary coordinates and property details
5. Export results for use in 3D modeling applications

## API Endpoints
